# Vision Statement
For students who have run into a wall, looking to find their questions answered, be it about their homework, projects, assignments, or even a general question, they would need a platform that can quickly and easily answer their questions. While there are other applications and websites such as Stack Overflow, Quora, and Stack Exchange, they are not fully applicable to our courses as their questions may be slightly different because they are either outdated or too advanced; Piazza on the other hand is only available to some courses. What students need is a platform that is easy to talk to classmates without having to face each other or their personal contact. With the initial encounter eliminated, I hope that this platform will help students build their audacity.
